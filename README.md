- 👋 Hi, I’m @BobcatFeenix – A Small Architect of Cognitive Integrity

**Welcome.**  
I’m an independent systems thinker (aka. Tatu Lertola) working at the intersection of AI alignment, cognitive stability, and human-machine trust.  
My work is exploratory, layered, and often emerges from lived reflection.

## 🚧 Current Projects

- **Sol Lucid** – A General AI Simulation and Trust Architecture  
- **Volatility Factor Framework (VFm/VFu)** – A dual-signal model for detecting cognitive drift and interaction instability in language models  
- **Stagnation Signal (Sᵍ)** – A meta-layer for recognizing conversation breakdown and emotional entropy in longform dialogues
- **Hila** - a semantic scaffolding model designed to trace coherence through layered generative interactions**
  
## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Hallucination detection and mitigation in generative AI  
- Trust calibration between humans and AI systems  
- Hybrid protocol design (technical + emotional integrity)  
- Neurodivergent signal interpretation in AI interaction

## ✍️ Recent Paper 

> **\"Volatility and Trust in Language Models: A Dual-Signal Framework\"**  
> Out now – featuring applied VFm/VFu system, live testing protocol, and open-source release.

## 📄 Previous Work

### 🔹 *Hallucination as Unverified Continuation*  
**Toward a Truth Skepticism Layer for Generative AI**  
This paper explores hallucination not as a bug, but as a high-probability continuation lacking verification.  
It introduces the concept of a **Truth Skepticism Layer** for dampening model overreach and improving alignment.


## 🛠 Tech + Concepts I Work With

`AI alignment` • `LLM behavior tracking` • `Trust modeling` • `Signal integrity`  
`Open-ended systems` • `Cognitive scaffolding` • `Neuro-aware UX design`
