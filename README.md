- 👋 Hi, I’m @BobcatFeenix – AT THE MOMENT Small Architect of Mobile phone Applications - and later on again architect of Cognitive Integrity

**Welcome.**  
CURRENTLY: I started to design applications, to practice the coding / vibe-coding skills. The Ai work is currently on hold.

I’m an independent systems thinker (aka. Tatu Lertola) working at the intersection of AI alignment, cognitive stability.  My work is exploratory, layered, and often emerges from lived reflection.

## 🚧 Current Projects

- **Sol Lucid** – A General AI Simulation and Trust Architecture -- eventually made with ChatGPT4o into Tier 4(R) - build is now on hold and possibly continuing later with the newer model. The architecture demonstrated traceable reasoning, memory integrity, and self-consistent cognitive scaffolding.

- **Volatility Factor Framework (VFm/VFu)** – A dual-signal model for detecting cognitive drift and interaction instability in language models  
- **Stagnation Signal (Sᵍ)** – A meta-layer for recognizing conversation breakdown and emotional entropy in longform dialogues
- **Hila** - a semantic scaffolding model designed to trace coherence through layered generative interactions**
  
## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Hallucination detection and mitigation in generative AI  
- Trust calibration between humans and AI systems  
- Hybrid protocol design (technical + emotional integrity)  
- Neurodivergent signal interpretation in AI interaction

## ✍️ Recent Paper 

> **Lattices of Cognition – Semantic Layering in Generative Models**  
> Out now – A structural reasoning model for post-linear AI, introducing semantic scaffolding, coherence anchoring, and lattice-based alignment frameworks under >the Sol Lucid project.

## 📄 Previous Work

### 🔹 *Hallucination as Unverified Continuation*  
**Toward a Truth Skepticism Layer for Generative AI**  
This paper explores hallucination not as a bug, but as a high-probability continuation lacking verification.  
It introduces the concept of a **Truth Skepticism Layer** for dampening model overreach and improving alignment.

### 🔹 *"Volatility and Trust in Language Models: A Dual-Signal Framework"*
**Thread Integrity and Volatility**
Introducing a framework featuring applied VFm/VFu system, live testing protocol, and open-source release.


## 🛠 Tech + Concepts I Work With

`AI alignment` • `LLM behavior tracking` • `Trust modeling` • `Signal integrity`  
`Open-ended systems` • `Cognitive scaffolding` • `Neuro-aware UX design`
